# Public Assets

This folder contains static assets that are served directly by Vite.

## Structure

```
public/
├── favicon.ico       # (to be added) Site favicon
├── vite.svg          # (to be added) Vite logo
└── images/           # (to be added) Image assets
```

## Usage

Files in this directory are served at the root path.

For example:
- `public/favicon.ico` → `/favicon.ico`
- `public/images/logo.png` → `/images/logo.png`

## Notes

- Place SVG icons, favicons, and other static assets here
- Assets are copied as-is without processing
- Reference assets using absolute paths starting with `/`

- [ ] Add vite.svg
